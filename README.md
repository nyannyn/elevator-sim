# Elevator Simulator

Elevator Simulator is a web-based simulation of elevator operations, built with TypeScript and p5.js. The simulator allows users to experiment with different elevator control strategies, adjust parameters such as the number of cars, speed, floors, and observe the impact on efficiency and profit.
